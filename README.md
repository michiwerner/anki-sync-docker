# Anki Sync Server Docker

A Docker container for running a self-hosted Anki sync server.

## Quick Start with GitHub Container Registry

```
docker run -d \
  --name anki-sync-server \
  -p 27701:27701 \
  -e SYNC_USER1=username:password \
  -v anki-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/michiwerner/anki-sync-docker:latest
```

## Platform Support

This image supports multiple architectures:
- `linux/amd64` - For Intel/AMD processors
- `linux/arm64` - For ARM64 processors (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 4/5, AWS Graviton, etc.)

Docker will automatically pull the correct image for your platform.

## Build Locally

```
docker build -t anki-sync-server .
```

To build with a specific Anki version:

```
docker build -t anki-sync-server --build-arg ANKI_VERSION=25.02.5 .
```

## Run

```
docker run -d \
  --name anki-sync-server \
  -p 27701:27701 \
  -e SYNC_USER1=username:password \
  -v anki-data:/data \
  anki-sync-server
```

The server will always be running and ready to accept connections from Anki clients.

## Docker Compose

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Make sure to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to set your username and password.

You can specify a different Anki version in the `docker-compose.yml` file by changing the `ANKI_VERSION` build arg.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. Builds the Docker image on pushes to main branch and tags
2. Pushes the image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
3. Creates versioned tags for releases
4. Builds multi-architecture images for both AMD64 and ARM64 platforms

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`.

### Version Matching

The CI/CD pipeline automatically matches the Anki version to the image tag:

- When building from a version tag (e.g., `v25.02.5`), the Docker image uses that same version of Anki and is tagged with the version without the "v" prefix (e.g., `25.02.5`)
- When building from the main branch, the image uses the latest Anki version (defined in the workflow file) and is tagged as `latest`
- If a git tag version matches the latest Anki version, the image is also tagged as `latest`

This ensures that specific tagged images always match their corresponding Anki versions.

### Image Tags

The following tags are automatically generated:
- `latest` - Latest build from the main branch (or when a git tag matches the latest Anki version)
- `X.Y.Z` - Semantic version tags (when you create a git tag like `vX.Y.Z`, the 'v' prefix is removed)
- `X.Y` - Major.Minor version tags
- `sha-XXXXXX` - Short commit SHA

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `SYNC_USER1`: Required. Format is `username:password` for the first user
- `SYNC_USER2`, `SYNC_USER3`, etc.: Optional additional users
- `SYNC_HOST`: Host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `SYNC_PORT`: Port to bind to (default: 27701)
- `SYNC_BASE`: Data storage location (default: /data)
- `PASSWORDS_HASHED`: Set to 1 if providing hashed passwords
- `MAX_SYNC_PAYLOAD_MEGS`: Maximum payload size in megabytes


### Build Arguments

- `ANKI_VERSION`: The Anki version to build the sync server from (default: 25.02.5)

### Volumes

- `/data`: Stores all sync data

### User Permissions

The container runs as a non-root user with UID/GID 1000:1000. If you're mounting a volume from your host, make sure it has appropriate permissions.

## Client Setup

In Anki desktop, go to Preferences â†’ Network and set the custom sync server URL to:

```
http://your-server-ip:27701/
```

For AnkiMobile, ensure "Allow Anki to access local network" is enabled in iOS settings.

## Security Considerations

This server uses unencrypted HTTP. For public access, consider using:
- A VPN
- HTTPS reverse proxy
- Container networking isolation
