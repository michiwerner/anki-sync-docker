# Anki Sync Server Docker

A Docker container for running a self-hosted Anki sync server.

## Quick Start with GitHub Container Registry

```
docker run -d \
  --name anki-sync-server \
  -p 27701:27701 \
  -e SYNC_USER1=username:password \
  -v anki-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/michiwerner/anki-sync-docker:latest
```

## Platform Support

This image supports multiple architectures:
- `linux/amd64` - For Intel/AMD processors
- `linux/arm64` - For ARM64 processors (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 4/5, AWS Graviton, etc.)

Docker will automatically pull the correct image for your platform.

## Build Locally

```
docker build -t anki-sync-server .
```

To build with a specific Anki version:

```
docker build -t anki-sync-server --build-arg ANKI_VERSION=25.02.5 .
```

## Run

```
docker run -d \
  --name anki-sync-server \
  -p 27701:27701 \
  -e SYNC_USER1=username:password \
  -v anki-data:/data \
  anki-sync-server
```

The server will always be running and ready to accept connections from Anki clients.

## Docker Compose

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Make sure to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to set your username and password.

You can specify a different Anki version in the `docker-compose.yml` file by changing the `ANKI_VERSION` build arg.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the building and pushing of the Docker image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). The workflow handles different scenarios:

1.  **Push to `main` branch:**
    *   Builds the Docker image using the `LATEST_ANKI_VERSION` (defined in the workflow file) for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms.
    *   Pushes the multi-architecture image and tags it solely as `latest`.

2.  **Push to a version tag (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`):**
    *   Extracts the version `X.Y.Z` from the tag.
    *   Builds the Docker image using this specific Anki version for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms.
    *   Pushes the multi-architecture image and tags it with the version (e.g., `X.Y.Z`).
    *   If the version `X.Y.Z` from the tag matches the `LATEST_ANKI_VERSION`, the `latest` tag is also updated to point to this build.

3.  **Pull Request to `main` branch (and other cases):**
    *   Builds the Docker image using the `LATEST_ANKI_VERSION` for the `linux/amd64` platform only.
    *   The image is **not** pushed to the registry. This step is for validation and testing.

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`. It leverages multi-platform builds and caching for efficiency.

### Image Tags

The following primary tags are automatically generated and pushed to GHCR based on the CI/CD pipeline:

-   `latest`:
    *   Updated on every push to the `main` branch (points to the image built with `LATEST_ANKI_VERSION`).
    *   Also updated when a version tag (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`) is pushed, if that version `X.Y.Z` matches the `LATEST_ANKI_VERSION`.
-   `X.Y.Z`:
    *   Created when a git tag like `vX.Y.Z` is pushed. The image is built with Anki version `X.Y.Z` and tagged as `X.Y.Z` (the 'v' prefix is removed).

For pull request builds, temporary tags (e.g., `build-<PR_NUMBER>-<SHA>`) might be generated for caching and identification purposes but are not pushed to the public registry.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `SYNC_USER1`: Required. Format is `username:password` for the first user
- `SYNC_USER2`, `SYNC_USER3`, etc.: Optional additional users
- `SYNC_HOST`: Host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `SYNC_PORT`: Port to bind to (default: 27701)
- `SYNC_BASE`: Data storage location (default: /data)
- `PASSWORDS_HASHED`: Set to 1 if providing hashed passwords
- `MAX_SYNC_PAYLOAD_MEGS`: Maximum payload size in megabytes


### Build Arguments

- `ANKI_VERSION`: The Anki version to build the sync server from (default: 25.02.5)

### Volumes

- `/data`: Stores all sync data

### User Permissions

The container runs as a non-root user with UID/GID 1000:1000. If you're mounting a volume from your host, make sure it has appropriate permissions.

## Client Setup

In Anki desktop, go to Preferences â†’ Network and set the custom sync server URL to:

```
http://your-server-ip:27701/
```

For AnkiMobile, ensure "Allow Anki to access local network" is enabled in iOS settings.

## Security Considerations

This server uses unencrypted HTTP. For public access, consider using:
- A VPN
- HTTPS reverse proxy
- Container networking isolation
